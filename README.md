<p>The purpose of this project was to use my HTML/Bootstrap/CSS skills to demonstrate how Mercedes has dominated the last 7 years in Forumla One.

The data was pulled from Kaggle as csv files. I used a jupyter notebook to import pandas for my data clean up and matplotlib for the plots.

I created dataframes of each year of the Constructor Results and created horizontal bar charts for each. I also made a dataframe of the sum of the years 2014-2020 to show how far ahead Mercedes is currently.</p>
